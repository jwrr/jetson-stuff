JETSON NANO
===========

I have no idea what I'm doing.  This is my personal playground to play with 
the Jetson Nano and maybe learn something.

Day 1
-----
Didn't get far. I found a micro-b cable, but need Ethernet cable and SD card.

Day 2
-----
I scrounged an Ethernet cable and SD card.  Fortunately my laptop had an sd reader/writer.
Installation was easy and bring up was easy (just follow Getting Started). I'm writing
this post from the Jetson.
